                        I am a passionate Software Developer and Research Enthusiast from Sri Lanka with a deep interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Software Engineering. My experience spans frontend development with Next.js and React, backend technologies such as Spring Boot, and working on collaborative projects that bring real-world applications to life.
                        <br /><br />

                        My recent research explores the Effect of Labeling AI-Generated Contentâ€”Deepfakes in Social Media. This research delves into the ethical, technological, and policy-related challenges of AI, which I find crucial in today&apos;s digital age.
                        <br /><br />

                        Throughout my journey, I have actively participated in hackathons, ideathons, and research projects, driven by a curiosity about how technology can positively impact people&apos;s lives and empower communities. I seize every valuable opportunity through hard work and dedication, always striving to make the most of my experiences.
                        <br /><br />

                        In addition to my technical expertise, I am a strong team player and leader. As Industry Engagement Lead of the IEEE Student Branch of UCSC, and holding various roles in organizations like AIESEC and Rotaract, I have developed leadership and decision-making skills, ensuring successful collaborations and innovative outcomes.
                        I am always eager to learn and grow, applying my skills to solve real-world problems. I believe in the power of technology to create meaningful change, and I strive to ensure that innovations are inclusive, ethical, and equitable.
